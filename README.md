### <a name="config"></a> Basic configurations

#### <a name="os"></a> Operating System : 
Ubuntu/Xubuntu

#### <a name="browser"></a> Browser : 
Firefox with built in firefox dev tools and **firebug**, and also a screengrab add on. Also Chrome with chrome developer tools.

#### <a name="hosting"></a> Hosting : 
Firebase/Gh-pages/Heroku/AWS

#### <a name="editor"></a> Editor : 
Atom with beautifier

### <a name="stack"></a>Stack

I use **MERN** stack a lot lately, i.e. Mongo db, Express, React and Nodejs. I have also worked with MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) and SPRING MVC in the past. To handle state management issues with React, I use **Redux**. 

### <a name="cms"></a>CMS

I use Jekyll - the static site generator based on Liquid. I have also tried Prismic.io - the headless CMS and paired it up with some Bootstrap on the frontend.

### <a name="task"></a>Task Runner

I use Gulp to compile, minify, lint my code and more.

### <a name="css"></a>CSS Framework and Preprocessor

Bootstrap is my choice because it makes it so easy to design responsive pages. **SASS** is my choice of preprocessor, but I have also used LESS in the past.

###  <a name="js"></a>Package management

I use **Yarn** because it is much faster, but NPM is also pretty good.

### <a name="Tdd"></a> TDD and CI
 I use **Jest and Enzyme** for testing, and **Travis** for continuous integration.

### <a name="des"></a>Design

Photoshop and Illustrator

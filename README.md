# My Frontend Development setup

This is a list of development tools, and setups for those tools that I use for my front end development work. This is not an exhaustive list by any means.

### Basic configurations

**Operating System** : Ubuntu/Xubuntu

**Browser** : Firefox with built in firefox dev tools and **firebug**, and also a screengrab add on.

**Hosting** : Firebase/Gh-pages/Heroku/AWS

**Editor** : Atom with beautifier

#### Stack

I use MERN stack a lot lately, i.e. Mongo db, Express, React and Nodejs. I have also worked with MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) in the past.

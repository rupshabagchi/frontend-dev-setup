# My Frontend Web Development setup

This is a list of development tools, and setups for those tools that I use for my front end development work. This is not an exhaustive list by any means.

**Operating System** : Ubuntu/Xubuntu

### Stack

I use MERN stack a lot lately, i.e. Mongo db, Express, React and Nodejs. I have also worked with MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) in the past.

### CMS

I use Jekyll - the static site generator based on Liquid. I have also tried Prismic.io - the headless CMS and paired it up with some Bootstrap on the frontend.

### Task Runner

I use Gulp to compile, minify, lint my code and more.

### CSS Framework and Preprocessor

Bootstrap is my choice because it makes it so easy to design responsive pages. 
SASS/LESS

###  JS Framework

React

### Design

Photoshop and Illustrator
